Question 5: Explain the importance of comments in JavaScript and provide examples of single-line and
multi-line comments.

Answer: Comments in JavaScript are used to add notes to your code that are ignored by the interpreter and do not affect the behavior of the program. Comments are useful for documenting your code, explaining what the code does, and making it easier for other developers to understand and modify your code.

Here are some examples of single-line and multi-line comments in JavaScript:

Single-line comments:

// This is a single-line comment.

Multi-line comments:

/*
This is a multi-line comment.
It can span multiple lines.
*/
