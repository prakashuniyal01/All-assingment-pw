Question 6: Explain the importance of choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names in JavaScript.
Provide an example where using a clear identifier improves code readability. 

Answer: Choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names in JavaScript is important for several reasons:

Improved code readability: Using meaningful and descriptive variable names makes your code more readable and understandable. Variable names should clearly indicate what the variable represents, which makes it easier for other developers to understand your code.

Improved code maintainability: Using meaningful and descriptive variable names makes your code more maintainable. If you choose descriptive variable names, it will be easier to modify or update your code in the future, as you will know what each variable represents.

Improved code performance: Using meaningful and descriptive variable names can also improve the performance of your code. By using short and concise variable names, you can reduce the amount of memory used by your program, which can improve its speed and efficiency.
