 Question 2: Explain the key differences between JavaScript and HTML. Provide examples of situations where
you would use each.

Answer: JavaScript and HTML are both programming languages used for creating web pages, but they have some key differences.

One of the main differences between JavaScript and HTML is that JavaScript is a programming language that is used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages, while HTML is a markup language that is used to structure and display content on web pages.

Here are some examples of situations where you would use JavaScript and HTML:

Adding interactivity to a web page: JavaScript can be used to create animations, form validation, and other types of interactivity on a web page. For example, you can use JavaScript to create a slideshow that changes images or to create a game that responds to user input.

Creating dynamic content: JavaScript can be used to create dynamic content on a web page, such as updating the content of a web page based on user input or changing the content based on time. For example, you can use JavaScript to display the current time on a web page or to display stock prices.

Creating interactive forms: HTML can be used to create forms on a web page, but JavaScript can be used to add interactivity to the form, such as validating user input or submitting the form data to a server. For example, you can use JavaScript to create a search form that filters search results based on user input.

Creating web applications: JavaScript can be used to create web applications that interact with a server and update the content of a web page dynamically. For example, you can use JavaScript to create a chat application that allows users to send and receive messages, or to create a to-do list application that allows users to add and remove tasks.
