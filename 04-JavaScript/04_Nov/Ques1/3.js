Question 3: List and describe the five primitive data types in JavaScript.

Answer:

1. Number: This data type is used to represent numeric values, such as integers and floating-point numbers. For example: 10, 3.14, -5.

2. String: This data type is used to represent text and character data. Strings are enclosed in single or double quotes. For example: 'Hello', "World", '123'.

3. Boolean: This data type is used to represent true or false values. Boolean values are represented by the keywords true and false.

4. Undefined: This data type is used to represent a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value.

5. Null: This data type is used to represent a variable that has been explicitly assigned a value of null. Null is a special value that represents the absence of any object value.

In JavaScript, all variables are considered to be of a primitive data type unless they are explicitly declared as an object or a reference to an object.
