Question 1: Explain what JavaScript is and its role in web development.


Answer: JavaScript is a programming language that is used to make web pages interactive. It is a client-side scripting language that is used to make web pages dynamic and interactive. It is used to create special effects on web pages like rollover, roll out and many types of graphics. JavaScript is also used to validate forms and create cookies. JavaScript is a scripting language that is used to create and control dynamic website content, i.e. anything that moves, refreshes, or otherwise changes on your screen without requiring you to manually reload a web page. JavaScript is a client-side scripting language, which means the source code is processed by the client's web browser rather than on the web server. This means JavaScript functions can run after a webpage has loaded without communicating with the server. JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website (for example games, responses when buttons are pressed or data entered in forms, dynamic styling, animation). JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)
