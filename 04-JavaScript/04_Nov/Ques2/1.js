Q1. Explain the role of operators in JavaScript. Why are they essential in programming?

Answer:
Operators in JavaScript are symbols or keywords used to perform operations on values or variables. There are several types of operators in JavaScript, including arithmetic operators, comparison operators, logical operators, and assignment operators.

Here are some examples of operators in JavaScript:

Arithmetic operators: These operators are used to perform arithmetic operations on values, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Examples of arithmetic operators in JavaScript include +, -, *, /, %, and ++.

Comparison operators: These operators are used to compare two values and return a boolean value indicating whether the comparison is true or false. Examples of comparison operators in JavaScript include ==, !=, ===, !==, <, >, <=, and >=.

Logical operators: These operators are used to combine two or more boolean values and return a boolean value. Examples of logical operators in JavaScript include &&, ||, and !.

Assignment operators: These operators are used to assign a value to a variable. Examples of assignment operators in JavaScript include =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, and ++.
