Q3. Differentiate between unary, binary, and ternary operators in JavaScript. Give examples of each.

Answer:
Unary operators: These operators are used to perform operations on a single operand. Examples include ++ (increment), -- (decrement), + (unary plus), - (unary minus), typeof, and delete.
Example:

let x = 5;
let y = ++x; // y = 6, x = 6
let z = --x; // z = 5, x = 5

Binary operators: These operators are used to perform operations on two operands. Examples include + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), % (modulus), == (equal to),!= (not equal to), < (less than), > (greater than), <= (less than or equal to), >= (greater than or equal to), && (logical AND), || (logical OR), and, or, not, and the ternary operator.
Example:

let x = 5;
let y = 3;
let z = x + y; // z = 8

Ternary operator: This operator is used to assign a value to a variable based on a condition. It has the following syntax: condition? value1 : value2.
Example:

let x = 5;
let y = x > 3? "greater than 3" : "less than or equal to 3"; // y = "greater than 3"

In the above example, if the condition "x > 3" is true, the value of y will be "greater than 3". Otherwise, it will be "less than or equal to 3".
